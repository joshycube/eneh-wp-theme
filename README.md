====================

Presume that you already have nodejs installed with npm, bower, grunt and compass with compass-normalize

Grid system - Greedo
====================

Greedo - 12 columns content first SCSS based grid system with 4 breakpoints:

- Death Star for larger screens (big displays)
- Star destroyer for large screens (laptops, desktops, large tablets)
- AT-AT for smaller screens (tablets portraits and tablet/mobile landscapes)
- Tie fighter for small screens (mobile portraits)

Grido follows the content based breakpoint idea which means you have to set up your breakpoints based on your content needs.
You can modify the settings under the /* Breakpoints */ section and also under /* Grid settings  */ sections in settings.scss.

EMS (em) is the main unit used by Greedo. 
The formula is target รท context = result,
body font-size: 100% (16px) then 1em = 16px.
Usage: 21px / 16px = 1.3125em.
